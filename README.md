Location based events research based on wikipedia and other sources

## Goal
The goal is to build an interactive map (web and mobile) where information about specific historical or political locations can be found by people so we can preserve the history of mankind!

## Description
We want to find a way to generate information about events or locations that has a historical or political significance and happended in a specific POI's (Point Of Interest) around the world.
A POI can be a geographical area (continent, country, city, street, building, a certain set of coordinates).

An example of a POI can be: 
title: "The assination of the greek politician Grigoris Lambrakis"
location: "Intersection between Venizelou and Ermou"
coordinates: "40.6359791 22.9410614"
info: "On May 22, 1963, Grigoris Lambrakis (Greek: Γρηγόρης Λαμπράκης; 3 April 1912 – 27 May 1963), a Greek politician, physician, track and field athlete, member of the faculty of the School of Medicine at the University of Athens and member of the Greek resistance to Axis rule during WWII shortly after he had delivered the keynote speech at an anti-war meeting in Thessaloniki, two far-right extremists, Emannouel Emannouilides and Spyros Gotzamanis, driving a three-wheeled vehicle, struck Lambrakis with a club over the head in plain view of a large number of people and (allegedly) some police officers. He suffered brain injuries and died in the hospital five days later, on May 27. The two men were arrested because of the reaction of a by-stander (Manolis Hatziapostolou, nicknamed Tiger) who jumped on their vehicle and fought with them."

## Event Generation
The generation of the POI's is the most challenging problem of this project. The idea is that this will be done by a community of users that want to contribute and register information about a POI that they know or have heard about. The pilor information generation can be done
