# mycity-data
Location based events research based on wikipedia and other sources


## General purpose
We want to find a way to generate historical-political information about events that happended in a specific POI's (Point Of Interest) around the world.
A POI can be a geographical area (continent, country, city, street, building, a certain set of coordinates) where a significant event has happened in the past.

## Goal
The goal is to build an interactive map (web and mobile) where these information can be found by people so we can preserve the history of mankind!
